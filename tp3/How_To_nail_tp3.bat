How_To_nail_tp3.bat
--------------------
first of all I made the whole project runnable on windows7 , 

I took tp2 as an instance , 

the whole code has always been compilable , 

but this time I fixed an error appearing on windows 7 , 

we made the code runnable on windows 7 , 

now We can assume that the code normally works for both : 
Windows & linux ! 

---------------------------------------------------------
step 1.2 : 
<pre-step> 



commit 
Readme , How_To_nail_tp3 , Img

"started_Progressing+ReplacedImg+UpdatedReadme"

<done> 
---------------------------------------------------------
Second step : 

*checking files 
-> found out that : 
                (main.cpp & instance.ccp)
|they don't need to be edited cause there ain't a point| 
<done> 


the true thing that remains in common between 
tp 2 & tp 3 , is the matrix display , 
we gonna make sure that the matrix 
display is gonna be modular 

*achieved modularity ! 
<done> 

*replace all manual prints 
with modular print , 
while keeping : ( the useful prints )

<done> 


*UpdatedReadme 
<done> 

commit 
Readme,DPkDispersionMemKN.cpp
"UpdatedReadme+ModularShowMatrix"


"done"
---------------------------------------------------------
3rd step : 

we gonna remove all the useless code 
and prints 
(useless matrix display included)

"ignored"
:We Would Use everything: 

comprehend how to solve this problem : 
1.check the pdf sildeshow 
2.check the researches the guy posted 

3.drop a conclusion form 1 & 2

=> Conclusion Dropped 
Conclusion : 
"keep tp2 & create compute within it"
<done> 


*
4. build a plan from the conculsion , 
on how to begin the work ! 

5. type the plan on pseudoCodeC++.cpp 
prolly as a comment 
(it's a file for the pseudo code)
create that file & work on it ! 

<moving the current task to next step>
"doing"

*established the identiy of "i" & "k"
:done:

*decided to work using the algorithm 2 ; 
beofre the destruction of the matrix 
I shall launch my algorithm3 ! 

:done: 




*from the previous pre-step , 
start typing the pseudo-code ! 
"done" 

*make pseudo code compile 
"done"
