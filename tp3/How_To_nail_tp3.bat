How_To_nail_tp3.bat
--------------------
first of all I made the whole project runnable on windows7 , 

I took tp2 as an instance , 

the whole code has always been compilable , 

but this time I fixed an error appearing on windows 7 , 

we made the code runnable on windows 7 , 

now We can assume that the code normally works for both : 
Windows & linux !

step 1.2 : 
<pre-step> 



commit 
Readme , How_To_nail_tp3 , Img

"started_Progressing+ReplacedImg+UpdatedReadme"

---------------------------------------------------------
Second step : 

<current step>  

*checking files 
-> found out that : 
                (main.cpp & instance.ccp)
|they don't need to be edited cause there ain't a point| 

the true thing that remains in common between 
tp 2 & tp 3 , is the matrix display , 
we gonna make sure that the matrix 
display is gonna be modular
